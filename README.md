# Trees-Kruskals-Prims-Algorithms

This Java program implements Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing, allowing users to input the size of the graph and choose between Kruskal's, Prim's, or comparing both algorithms based on their execution times. The code generates a random weighted graph, applies the selected algorithm, and displays the MST along with their total costs. This project is suitable for learning about MST algorithms in Java.
